# Query
Trying to implement a **local query engine** as a learning exercise

# What currently works
- Reading a CSV file into memory
- Parsing each row splitting its values
- ~~Querying or filtering rows by a search term, currently only by species~~
- Querying or filtering rows by a **selection** of columns and a condition 

# Working on
- Pretty printing tables
